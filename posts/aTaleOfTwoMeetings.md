# A Tale of Two Meetings

>In the best of times we forget the worst of times exist. In our attempts to
be wise, we often act foolish. Seeking to prove our beliefs, we entrench
behind incredulity. We turn the spotlight on ourselves, hiding others in
darkness. We preach hope to others while wading through despair ourselves.
With all the potential solutions before us, we can see no way forward.

I recently read a [series of interesting
studies](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/nicholas.epley/EpleyandDunning2001.pdf)
about our ability to estimate other's abilities and how we rate our own
ability. In the studies, the proctors discovered that we often rate our own
abilities significantly above average, and estimate other's abilities fairly
accurately. For example, the proctors ran a study asking students how many
flowers they would personally buy during an upcoming fundraiser and how many
they expected their peers to buy. The study found the participants severely
overestimated how many they personally would buy, but correctly guessed the
average number of flowers participants would buy. Give it a read if you're
interested. The point is, we are inherently biased in our own opinions and
seek to pump up our self-esteem by assuming we're better than everyone else.
Unfortunately, this bias towards our own ideas tends to rear its ugly head
when two people with dominant personalities differ on ideas. Each person
entrenches in their idea, and refuses to acknowledge the other side, even
going so far as to ignore valid evidence presented by the other person.

Recently I found myself in a meeting over the refactoring of a feature
adjacent to a well-known business requirement. The business requirements had
been in place for 2 or 3 years with very little change, had well defined case
studies, and had unit tests showing required inputs and outputs to the
domain. The business case was not being refactored, but the code calling it
was. Initially, months earlier, my team had presented the business case and
the domain to the refactor team, and had shown them the math and case studies
behind the implementation so they had some idea of what to expect when they
fed values in to the domain.
