# A Tale of Two Meetings

>In the best of times we forget the worst of times exist. In our attempts to
be wise, we often act foolish. Seeking to prove our beliefs, we entrench
behind incredulity. We turn the spotlight on ourselves, hiding others in
darkness. We preach hope to others while wading through despair ourselves.
With all the potential solutions before us, we can see no way forward.

I recently read a [series of interesting
studies](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/nicholas.epley/EpleyandDunning2001.pdf)
about our ability to estimate other's abilities and how we rate our own
ability. In the studies, the proctors discovered that we often rate our own
abilities significantly above average, and estimate other's abilities fairly
accurately. For example, the proctors ran a study asking students how many
flowers they would personally buy during an upcoming fundraiser and how many
they expected their peers to buy. The study found the participants severely
overestimated how many they personally would buy, but correctly guessed the
average number of flowers participants would buy. Give it a read if you're
interested. The point is, we are inherently biased in our own opinions and
seek to pump up our self-esteem by assuming we're better than everyone else.
