My name is Eric Siebeneich, I am a Senior Consultant at [Improving Houston](http://improving.com/). I'm passionate about all things software, sometimes hardware, and gaming.

I've amassed 10+ years of development experience, with a mixture of web, server, game, theoretical, practical, architectural, procedural, and other disciplines.
