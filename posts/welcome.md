# Welcome to /dev/zeebo

My name is Eric Siebeneich, I am a Principal Consultant at [Improving
Houston](http://improving.com/). I'm passionate about all things software,
sometimes hardware, and gaming.

I've amassed 10+ years of development experience, with a mixture of web, server,
game, theoretical, practical, architectural, procedural, and other disciplines.

Drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericsiebeneich/) if
you're a developer wanting to get in on the consulting game, if you're looking
for help with your latest software ideas, or even if you want to know more about
things I talk about. I love talking details and learning others' opinions. Never
stop learning.
