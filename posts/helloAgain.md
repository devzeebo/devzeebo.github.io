# Hello Again

Wow, a lot happened in the past two years #understatement. I generally stopped
writing as I was dealing with adapting to the pandemic. This doesn't mean I
stopped learning; quite the contrary. Some of the things that happened:

* I gave up trying to manually install Arch, and installed **Manjaro** as a
daily driver. I really, _really_ enjoyed the experience and it was very good for
gaming as well. I ran Manjaro as my main platform for about 6 months. I switched
back to Windows as unfortunately the games I was playing at the time had
terrible DRM that prevented me running it in Linux.
* I changed clients! I currently work with **iHerb** on their warehouse systems.
Still doing React, but so much has changed in the past two years.
* Promotion! I'm now a **Principal Consultant** with Improving, and loving every
minute of it. Contact me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericsiebeneich/) if you're looking for a
job and I'll happily make introductions
* **React hooks**. This completely changed the way I write React. I **LOVE**
them and how much more readable React is with them. I actually rewrote large
portions of this site using them because it was painful to look at the old code.
* **.NET Core 5/6**. We're finally there. One unified .NET ecosystem. .NET
Framework is slowly falling out of favor as more and more companies upgrade to
.NET Core and it's fantastic. No more MVC/OWIN problems, Depenency Injection by
default, and the build pipleline actually works without Visual Studio. I think
that's my favorite thing about .NET Core actually. Oh, and it works flawlessly
on Linux and easily with Docker.
* The **TypeScript** tooling is now mature enough to be usable and it's
beautiful. Easy to use, provides strong type checking, and the dynamic types are
amazing. It's currently my favorite type system with the caveat that type
erasure is still a thing. Thankfully that doesn't come up often.
